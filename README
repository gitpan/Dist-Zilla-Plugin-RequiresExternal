NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RequiresExternal - make dists require external
    commands

VERSION
    version 0.1091005

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

        [RequiresExternal]
        requires = /path/to/some/executable
        requires = executable_in_path

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin creates a test in your distribution to check for
    the existence of executable commands you require.

ATTRIBUTES
  requires
    Each "requires" attribute should be either an absolute path to an
    executable or the name of a command in the user's "PATH" environment.
    Multiple "requires" lines are allowed.

    Example from a dist.ini file:

        [RequiresExternal]
        requires = sqlplus
        requires = /usr/bin/java

    This will require the program "sqlplus" to be available somewhere in the
    user's "PATH" and the program "java" specifically in /usr/bin.

METHODS
  gather_files
    Adds a t/requires_external.t test script to your distribution that
    checks if each "requires" item is executable.

  metadata
    Using this plugin will add Env::Path to your distribution's testing
    prerequisites since the t/requires_external.t script uses that module to
    look for executables in the user's "PATH".

SEE ALSO
    This module was indirectly inspired by Module::Install::External's
    requires_external_bin command.
