NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RequiresExternal - make dists require external
    commands

VERSION
    version 0.001091

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

        [RequiresExternal]
        requires = /path/to/some/executable
        requires = executable_in_path

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin creates a test in your distribution to check for
    the existence of executable commands you require.

ATTRIBUTES
  requires
    Each "requires" attribute should be either a full path to an executable
    or the name of a command in the user's "PATH" environment.

METHODS
  gather_files
    Adds a t/requires_external.t test script to the distribution that checks
    if each "requires" item is executable. Required by
    Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer.

  metadata
    Using this plugin will add the Env::Path to your distribution's testing
    prerequisites, since it uses that module to look for executables in the
    user's "PATH".
