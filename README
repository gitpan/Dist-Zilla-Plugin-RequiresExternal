NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RequiresExternal - make dists require external
    commands

VERSION
    version 0.1091005002002

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

        [RequiresExternal]
        requires = /path/to/some/executable
        requires = executable_in_path

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin creates a test in your distribution to check for
    the existence of executable commands you require.

ATTRIBUTES
  requires
    Each "requires" attribute should be either an absolute path to an
    executable or the name of a command in the user's "PATH" environment.
    Multiple "requires" lines are allowed.

    Example from a dist.ini file:

        [RequiresExternal]
        requires = sqlplus
        requires = /usr/bin/java

    This will require the program "sqlplus" to be available somewhere in the
    user's "PATH" and the program "java" specifically in /usr/bin.

  fatal
    Boolean value to determine if a failed test will immediately stop
    testing. It also causes the test name to change to
    t/000-requires_external.t so that it runs earlier. Defaults to false.

METHODS
  gather_files
    Adds a t/requires_external.t test script to your distribution that
    checks if each "requires" item is executable.

  metadata
    Using this plugin will add Test::Most and Env::Path to your
    distribution's testing prerequisites since the generated script uses
    those modules.

SEE ALSO
    This module was indirectly inspired by Module::Install::External's
    requires_external_bin command.
